Playing around with the riot api in python

## Getting Started

For my code to work you need to create a .json file name "configuration". This JSON need to contain the keys:

* server
* summonerName
* apikey

With his correspondent values

An example of this could be:

```
{"summonerName":"Blumberg","apikey":"FULL_API_HERE","server":"euw1"}
```

Then you should be good to go
